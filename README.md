# Project Approach
** In this pproject there is no need to make diffrent dunctionality as it is just a smalll single page web design assessment so there is no much about to describe about it
** The main approach to start the assignmanet was to visualize about how the different elements on this website are related to each other and which is the parent of an elemnt and in how many sub parts a particular element is divided 
For exmaple there was a para in which the last word is gray in color so i used
<p> Available for work <span class="text-gray-500" > Follow </span> </p>
** For a sticking element I have used a diffrent approach other then position sticky
** Similarly there were some cards at end of the page i have used linear gradient and opacity to achieve the desired effect 

** It was easy and simple even if I am a  fresher it shouldn't have taken me this much time I need to work harder and I am ready to do it
